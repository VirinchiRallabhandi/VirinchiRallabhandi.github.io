I am a mathematical physics student from Perth, Australia. I will soon begin a PhD at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of James Lucietti and Tim Adamo. I have previously studied Part III of the maths tripos at the University of Cambridge, a Master of Physics at the University of Western Australia (UWA) under the supervision of Sergei Kuzenko and Evgeny Buchbinder and a Bachelor of Science in maths and physics at UWA. This is my personal webpage containing both academic and non-academic endeavours.
