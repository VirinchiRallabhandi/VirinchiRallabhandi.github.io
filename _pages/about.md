I am a mathematical physics student from Perth, Australia. I will soon begin a PhD at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of [James Lucietti] (https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~jlucietti/) and [Tim Adamo] (https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tadamo/#). I have previously studied Part III of the maths tripos at the University of Cambridge, a Master of Physics at the University of Western Australia (UWA) under the supervision of [Sergei Kuzenko] (https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/sergei-kuzenko) and [Evgeny Buchbinder] (https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/evgeny-buchbinder) and a Bachelor of Science in maths and physics at UWA. This is my personal webpage containing both academic and non-academic endeavours.
