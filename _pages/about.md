I am a mathematical physics student from Perth, Australia. I am currently exploring various topics regarding black holes, as part of a PhD at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of James Lucietti. I have previously studied Part III of the Mathematical Tripos at the University of Cambridge, a Master of Physics at the University of Western Australia (UWA) under the supervision of Sergei Kuzenko & Evgeny Buchbinder and a Bachelor of Science in maths & physics at UWA. This is my personal webpage, containing both academic and non-academic endeavours.
