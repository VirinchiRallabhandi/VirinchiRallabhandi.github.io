I am a mathematical physics student from Perth, Australia. I am currently studying for a PhD at the University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of James Lucietti. I have been exploring various topics in general relativity, with a particular focus on positive energy theorems and quasilocal mass. This is my personal webpage, containing both academic and non-academic endeavours.
