This was the speech from an unsuccessful audition I gave to participate as a speaker in a Cambridge Union debate opposing the motion, "this house would rather have a queen than a president." I focused largely on why I oppose all monarchy on principle. However, I also tried to make the case that the lack of regular accountability and democratic rule inherent in monarchy seeps into other institutions too; as an example I took the House of Lords.
