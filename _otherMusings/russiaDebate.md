This was the speech from an unsuccessful audition I gave to participate as a speaker in a Cambridge Union debate proposing the motion, "this house believes Russia is a distraction." While not seeking to downplay the war in Ukraine in any way, I tried to put forward the idea that Russia is merely one element of a very large struggle against autocracy. I also explain that in this contest between democracy and autocracy, we must do much better at home to prove that democracy can work as a just system of government.
