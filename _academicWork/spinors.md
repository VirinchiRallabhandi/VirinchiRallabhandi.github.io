The object of this treatise is to give a general mathematical overview of spinors “from first principles.” In the perspective I’ll take here, the “first principles” are representations of the Clifford algebra; all properties of spinors are derived from studying irreducible representations of the Clifford algebra. The discussion does not involve original work; it is purely pedagogical in nature. This primer also appears as an appendix to my master's thesis at UWA. However, it was originally written as a standalone document, always intended to be self contained and does not share the notational conventions of my master's thesis.
