This work considers positive energy theorems in asymptotically, locally AdS spacetimes. Particular attention is given to spacetimes where conformal infinity has compact, Einstein cross-sections admitting Killing or parallel spinors; a positive energy theorem is derived for such spacetimes in terms of geometric data intrinsic to the cross-section. This is followed by the first complete proofs of the BPS inequalities in (the bosonic sectors of) 4D and 5D minimal, gauged supergravity, including with magnetic fields. The BPS inequalities are proven for asymptotically AdS spacetimes, but also generalised to the aforementioned class of asymptotically, locally AdS spacetimes.
