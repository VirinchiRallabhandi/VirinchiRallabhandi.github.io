A new notion of quasilocal mass is defined for generic, compact, two dimensional, space- like surfaces in four dimensional spacetimes with negative cosmological constant. The definition is spinorial and based on work for vanishing cosmological constant by Penrose and Dougan & Mason. Furthermore, this mass is non-negative, equal to the Misner-Sharp mass in spherical symmetry, equal to zero for every generic surface in AdS, has an ap- propriate form for gravity linearised about AdS and has an appropriate limit for large spheres in asymptotically AdS spacetimes.
