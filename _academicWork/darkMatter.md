title: "Strictly MDAR-following galaxies"
collection: academicWork
permalink: /academicWork/darkMatter
excerpt: "This is work I did for the UWA unit, PHYS3003, and is also a follow-up to my International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) studentship report. Although it's typset in the MNRAS template, the work was never submitted for publication. Furthermore, the fact my ICRAR supervisor's name, Gerhardt Meurer, doesn't appear in the author list should not be seen as a claim to sole ownership, merely a reflection that I submitted it for one of my assignments."

A fundamental tenet of MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is the Mass Discrepancy Acceleration Relation (MDAR) - a direct link between the acceleration observed and that predicted from Newton’s laws with a significant disparity only when the acceleration is lower than some MOND acceleration constant. Recent observations suggest MDAR indeed holds - at least statistically - on galaxy scales. Here, I consider the implications for dark matter assuming its distribution is such that MDAR is strictly reproduced. I examined the best differntail power law approximation to the dark matter density profile across various prescriptions for MOND interpolating function and baryonic mass distribution; there were very few cases in which the results agreed with those from ΛCDM simulations. Hence, I see a distinguishing feature between MOND and ΛCDM. While MDAR must hold strictly in MOND, it can only ever hold qualitatively in ΛCDM.
